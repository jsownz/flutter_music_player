Timelapse videos of these builds will be on my YouTube channel [Frozen Solid Designs](https://www.youtube.com/@frozensoliddesigns)

### Goal
My goal here is to become better at the Flutter language, and to help other people learn in that process. Additionally, getting some of these designers work out there is a huge bonus, these people do amazing work that I could never do. I plan on showcasing these designs and the designers themselves as well as any useful or interesting tools I come across in the process.

### Design
This design is from [Filip Legierski](https://dribbble.com/kedavra): [Dribble Concept](https://dribbble.com/shots/9338617-Simple-Music-Player)

### Fonts
We're using Google Fonts for this project, but I don't know the legality of pushing font files to GitHub, so I'll leave the actual font files out of this repo. Instead, I've included a fonts folder with placeholders for the font files needed. Be sure to add your own copy of the fonts used in the design before running this project. You can download them from [here: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat)

### Additional Tools
For stock images, I'll be using [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) which has an amazing collection of high quality, free photos and [Pexels] (https://www.pexels.com/) which also has a great free stock photo library.

For royality free music tracks, I'll be using [Chosic](https://www.chosic.com/free-music/lofi/) and [Free Music Archive](https://freemusicarchive.org/) which have a huge collection of creative commons licensed music that can be used both personally and commercially.
